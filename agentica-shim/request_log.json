The functions provided are index, create, update, and erase. These functions relate to managing articles in a BBS DB. The user is probably asking about the capabilities of the assistant. Since the tools are for handling articles, I should explain that I can list, create, update, or delete articles. But wait, the user might not know about these functions. I should outline each function's purpose clearly. Let me make sure I don't miss any functions. The index function lists all articles, create adds a new one, update modifies existing content, and erase removes an article. I should present this in a friendly manner. Also, the user might need guidance on which function to use. Maybe they want to know how to proceed with their request. I should keep the response helpful and concise, mentioning each function's description. That way, the user understands the options available.\n</think>\n\nI can help you manage articles in the BBS DB. Here's what I can do:\n\n1. **List all articles** (index): Show every article archived in the database.\n2. **Create a new article** (create): Write and save a new article to the database.\n3. **Update an article** (update): Modify the content of an existing article.\n4. **Delete an article** (erase): Remove an article from the database.\n\nLet me know what you'd like to do!"
